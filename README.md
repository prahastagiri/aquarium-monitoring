<h3>Hi!<h3>
<p> This is my mini project on aquarium monitoring. I want to make a system to control and monitor my aquarium that is a nano tank sized 30Cmx20Cmx30Cm. For now it only has autofeeder and lamp control. My next work will add a temperature control.</p>
<h3>Tools i'm using:</h3>
<li>Arduino Uno</li>
<li>Servo Motor</li>
<li>5v Relay</li>
<li>Jumper cables</li>
